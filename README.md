# Twitter Classifier


In order to run this code, you must have a python 2.7 or a python 3.4 versions and the following libraries:

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK - http://www.nltk.org/) scikit-learn (Machine Learning in Python - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

I also use ark_twitter_nlp as the Part-of-Speech tagger as well as the NLTK pos tagger.

The lexicon this library uses are:

NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~saif/WebPages/Abstracts/NRC-SentimentAnalysis.htm

Liu's Opinion Lexicon http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html

The final output of my code would be the sentiment (i.e. 'positive', 'negative' or 'neutral') predicted by the classifer along with the accuracy and confusion matrix.

The datasets I have used in my code are of SemEval 2014 which I cannot provide because of legal reasons. You can contact the organisers of the SemEval for the datasets.

Instead of using the NLTK tokenizer I have used the tokenizer built by Brendan O'Connor(http://github.com/brendano/tweetmotif)
